swiftSodukuSolver
=================

In which I try to learn swift by re-implementing a simple Soduku Game solver. This project is not intended
to be all that impressive, I just wanted to create something a little more complicated than a Hello World before I 
dove into Cocoa programming with Swift. It turned out to be a pretty good exercise.

This is re-implementation of the Soduku Solver lecture from an intro programming course at UBC. I figured the best
way to get the hang of Swift was to try to reproduce something I already knew using a new language. Since swift isn't
Lisp, the implementation isn't quite the same (doing everything with mutually recursive calls ran really slow).

The course that this project is adapted from is [available on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/programdesign)
