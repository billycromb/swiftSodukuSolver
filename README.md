swiftSodukuSolver
=================

In which I try to learn swift by re-implementing a simple sodukuSolver in the language. This project is not intended
to be all that impressive, I just wanted to create something a little more complicated than a Hello World before I 
dove into Cocoa programming with Swift.

This is basically a re-implementation of the Soduku Solver lecture from an intro programming course at UBC.
I figured the best way to get the hang of Swift was to try to reproduce something I already knew.

The course is [available on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/programdesign)
